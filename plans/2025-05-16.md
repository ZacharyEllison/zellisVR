# Plan for May 16, 2025

## Goals for Today (Detailed Breakdown)

1. **Enable VR and XR Support**
   - Update `index.html` to include WebXR/WebVR polyfills or libraries (e.g., three.js, A-Frame, or Babylon.js).
   - Ensure the main scene initialization supports both VR and XR modes.
   - Test device compatibility (Oculus, Vive, AR-capable browsers).

2. **Improve Sign Appearance**
   - Locate sign rendering code (likely in `index.html` or `config.js`).
   - Change sign color to a more palatable value (e.g., #4FC3F7 or another soft color).
   - Update sign shape to have border-radius (e.g., `border-radius: 20px` for rounder corners).
   - If using 3D, adjust geometry to a rounded rectangle.

3. **Set Default Sign Distance**
   - In the sign placement logic (likely in `config.js` or `index.html`), set the Z position so the sign is 20 feet (approx. 6.1 meters) from the user by default.
   - Example: `position: { x: 0, y: 1.5, z: -6.1 }` (if using meters and Y is eye level).

4. **Enhance Sign Messaging**
   - Update the sign's text to a friendly message (e.g., "Take a deep breath!" or a fun eye health fact).
     - Edit the sign text in the rendering logic (likely in `config.js` or `index.html`).
     - Consider randomizing between several friendly messages or facts for variety.
   - Use a friendly, readable font (e.g., 'Quicksand', or 'Nunito').
     - Add a `<link>` to Google Fonts in `index.html` for the chosen font.
     - Apply the font to the sign's text via CSS (for 2D) or set the font in the 3D text material (for 3D).
   - Apply font styling in CSS or 3D text material.
     - Example CSS: `.sign-text { font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif; font-size: 2rem; color: #333; }`
     - For 3D, set the font and color in the text geometry/material options.
   - Ensure the message is centered and visually balanced on the sign.
     - Use CSS properties like `text-align: center;` and `padding` for 2D, or adjust alignment in 3D text settings.
   - Test the appearance in both VR and XR modes to confirm readability and friendliness.

### Next Steps
- Review and update `index.html` and `config.js` for VR/XR and sign changes.
- Test in both VR and XR environments.
- Adjust values and styles as needed based on user feedback.
